CURRENT ROUTING OF CMDS:
Request : cmd.js => Router.js => [Respective]Controller => DataManager.js
Response : cmd.js <= Router.js <= [Respective]Controller <= DataManager.js

Need to build a ResponseBuilder.js class to dynamically create responses based
on the response object. Currently there are redundant functions to format responses.
This can be done in an external class and returned to the cmd.js file callback.

Business logic can be done in controller through external classes.
