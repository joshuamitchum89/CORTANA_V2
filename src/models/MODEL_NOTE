Models are useds to preform operations on data.

BM stands for business model and should be used for business logic
DM stands for data model and should be used for calling data or saving data

Business models such as profileBM can initialize it's data based on the db
model profileDM. Operations can be preformed on the profileBM without ever
affecting the profileDM. Ater these operations are made you can transfer the
values of a profileBM over to a profileDM to be saved into the db by using arguments
in the function call to populate the corresponding properties.
